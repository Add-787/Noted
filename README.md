## Setup and Configuration Guide
You can get started on developing this application by following a few steps:
- Clone this repository
- Add this project on your firebase account.
- Download the google-services.json file and add it to the app module.

## Design
I have followed the following standard practices for this project:
- Separation of ui and logic. The ui strictly only communicates with the viewmodel and is unaware of business logic.
- Integration of hilt for easier dependency injection.
- Usage of Jetpack compose for ui development.
